# Learn CSS Flexbox by example projects
This repository contains a couple of example projects using CSS **flexbox**. These projects will give you a clear concept of flexbox and how all things are working together.

This repository is a part of my blog post: :bulb: [Shihabiiuc.Com/Flexbox](https://shihabiiuc.com/flexbox/)

_And the post contains video explanations, text documents, etc. This is one of the posts that you will ever need to understand flexbox clearly._

In this project, I created the following examples that will touch mostly used flexbox properties:
- How to make a full-width form using flexbox?
- How to align multiple divs/items side by side?
- How to change the order of an element using flexbox?
- How to create equal-height columns/boxes using flexbox?
- How to create a gallery layout using flexbox?
- How to create nested rows & columns in flexbox?
- How to create a header navigation menu using flexbox?
